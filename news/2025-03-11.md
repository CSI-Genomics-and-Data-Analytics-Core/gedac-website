### New Tools and Software Updates 🧰

#### **Dorado Update** 🚀
Oxford Nanopore's basecalling software has received a significant update that brings impressive speed improvements for Nvidia GPUs, particularly Ampere-based GPUs. This enhancement will accelerate nanopore sequencing data processing workflows.

* **More information:** Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado/releases/tag/v0.9.1o)

#### **Realfreq Tool Release** 🧬
A new tool for calling methylated bases from MinION and PromethION flow cells has been released. What makes Realfreq particularly valuable is its ability to call methylated bases in real-time while the sequencing instrument is running.

* **Availability:** Completely open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/imsuneth/realfreq)
* **Research details:** Preprint available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.23.634192v1.full.pdf)
