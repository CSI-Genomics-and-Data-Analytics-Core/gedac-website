## 🗓️ Upcoming Conferences and Workshops

### 2025 Human Cell Atlas General Meeting

The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is an international initiative to identify and characterize all cells in the human body. To date, over **65.8 million cells** have been characterized using data from hundreds of single-cell sequencing projects.

The primary objective of this general meeting is to bring together domain experts to discuss updates to the HCA and how AI can be used to derive meaning from this unique biological resource.

- **Date:** Monday, June 9 to 11, 9:00am – 6:00pm SGT
- **Location:** SingHealth Academy
