## Getting started

**AstroWind** tries to give you quick access to creating a website using [Astro 4.0](https://astro.build/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a free theme which focuses on simplicity, good practices and high performance.

Very little vanilla javascript is used only to provide basic functionality so that each developer decides which framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Solid JS...) to use and how to approach their goals.

In this version the template supports all the options in the `output` configuration, `static`, `hybrid` and `server`, but the blog only works with `prerender = true`. We are working on the next version and aim to make it fully compatible with SSR.

### Project structure

Inside **AstroWind** template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   ├── _headers

└── ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.
