# Welcome

Welcome to the Genomics and Data Analytics Core at the National University of Singapore.  We are an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers working alongside researchers and clinicians to provide high-quality bioinformatics and data analytics support, access to the latest high performance computing infrastructure, and robust data storage and retrieval solutions.

## Services

We offer a range of services to support our clients at the university and industry partners across the island:
- Plan, design and analyze data produced from high-throughput sequencing experiments
- Provide dedicated access to HPC resources to support data-driven genomics research
- Securely archive, store and retrieve large-scale genomics datasets from the cloud

## Research

Our team has domain expertise in a wide range of research areas:
- Cancer Genomics
    - Characterizing genetic mutations and molecular pathways driving cancer.
    - Applications: Somatic mutation analysis, tumor evolution studies, and biomarker discovery.
- Epigenetics and Epitranscriptomics
    - Investigating genome structure, function, and regulation.
    - Applications: Whole genome sequencing (WGS), epigenetic modifications, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
- Microbial Genomics
    - Profiling microbial communities and their roles in ecosystems and health.
    - Applications: 16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and functional profiling.
- Plant and Animal Genomics
    - Profiling microbial communities and their roles in ecosystems and health.
    - Applications: 16S rRNA sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and functional profiling.
- Transcriptomics
    - Exploring gene expression dynamics through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).
    - Applications: Differential gene expression analysis, single-cell RNA-Seq, and spatial transcriptomics.


## Resources

The Genomics and Data Analytics Core (GeDaC) at the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI) is designed to meet the increasing need of bioinformatics and computational support for the institute labs and the university. Its mission is to: (1) provide investigators access to bioinformatics expertise and solutions, (2) use data science to enhance the impact of CSIâ€™s research and (3) develop innovative platforms for cancer genome analytics.
