# Welcome

Welcome to the Genomics and Data Analytics Core at the National University of Singapore.  We are an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers working alongside researchers and clinicians to provide high-quality bioinformatics and data analytics support, access to the latest high performance computing infrastructure, and robust data storage and retrieval solutions.

## Services

We offer a range of services to support our clients at the university and industry partners across the island:
- Plan, design and analyze data produced from high-throughput sequencing experiments
- Provide dedicated access to HPC resources to support data-driven genomics research
- Securely archive, store and retrieve large-scale genomics datasets from the cloud

## Research

Our team has domain expertise in a wide range of research areas:
- Cancer Genomics
    - Characterizing genetic mutations and molecular pathways driving cancer.
    - Applications: Somatic mutation analysis, tumor evolution studies, and biomarker discovery.
- Epigenetics and Epitranscriptomics
    - Investigating genome structure, function, and regulation.
    - Applications: Whole genome sequencing (WGS), epigenetic modifications, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
- Transcriptomics
    - Exploring gene expression dynamics through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq).
    - Applications: Differential gene expression analysis, single-cell RNA-Seq, and spatial transcriptomics.
