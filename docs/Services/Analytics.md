Welcome to our Support and Consultation page.  We are happy that you made it here.  This page will walk you through the services we offer, the benefits of working with us, and how to get started working together.

## What we Offer

We offer access to highly trained bioinformaticians who can help you and your team plan, design and analyze data produced from your high-throughput sequencing experiments.  Our staff scientists have expertise working on a wide range of sequencing applications from both short- and long-read sequencing experiments:
    - Direct RNA sequencing
    - Microbiome and shotgun metagenomoics
    - Single-cell and spatial genomics
    - Whole genome sequencing
    - Whole exome sequencing
    - Transcriptomics

## Why Choose Us?

Our team of staff scientists have decades of experience collaborating with clinicians and researchers on high-throughput sequencing projects.  We understand that every study design and every research question is unique, and we use this information to tailor our analysis specific to your study.

## How to Get Started?

If you made it this far, it sounds like you might be ready to start a conversation.  To get the ball moving, send us an email introducing yourself and a member of our team will respond shortly.  We look forward to the possibility of working with you and learning more about your amazing science.
