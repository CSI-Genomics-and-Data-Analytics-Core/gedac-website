# Data Management
Welcome to our Data Management page. We are happy that you made it here. This page will walk you through the services we offer, the benefits of working with us, and how to get started working together.

## What we Offer
We offer data management support to research groups looking to archive large genomic datasets in the cloud at a low cost (BAM, CRAM, FASTQ, POD5).  We also offer data migration support to research groups looking to securely retrieve or send genomic data to internal or external collaborators.

## Why Choose Us?
Our engineers work closely with our partners at Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide a low cost, secure and reliable data storage solution for your genomics data.  We manage genomics data for research groups at the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI), NUS School of Medicine, and National University Health System.  In fact, **47% of CSI faculty work with us to manage their data from legacy or ongoing genomics projects**.
