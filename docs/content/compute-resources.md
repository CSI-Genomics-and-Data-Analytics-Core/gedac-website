### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Cloud Platform

:::info **TL;DR:**  
AWS is ideal for workloads needing rapid scaling, flexible compute, or **short-term high-performance resources.** Best for fast turnaround when shared HPC queues are slow, but costs rise with large datasets.
:::

AWS Cloud Platform is well-suited for bioinformatics workloads that require rapid scaling, flexible compute configurations, or short-term access to high-performance resources. It is especially advantageous when fast turnaround is critical and queue times on shared HPC systems are a bottleneck. While AWS offers flexibility and speed, storage and data transfer costs increase with dataset size, making it most cost-effective for small to mid-sized workloads. Budget considerations are key, and effective cost management requires proper automation, monitoring, and workflow orchestration.
